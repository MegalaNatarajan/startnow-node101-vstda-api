VSTDA API
Front and back end teams will often agree on a "contract" about how a given application and its API should behave during the software design process. Each team can then work on their parts in parallel for efficiency. Eventually the teams will complete their required parts, and then the two teams will spend a brief period of time integrating the parts and testing the application.
Teams that work well together and implement their parts as agreed can often save time (and costs) using this strategy.
This project implement an API server using ExpressJS.
